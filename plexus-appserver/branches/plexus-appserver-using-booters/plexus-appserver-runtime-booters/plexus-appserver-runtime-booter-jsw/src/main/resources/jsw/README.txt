The directory structures here are copies verbatim of the tarballs/zips
provided by the project. I would eventually like to be able to pull them from 
the repository. The only change here is putting the common platform
independent files in a commons directory. Eventually this will be a
platform neutral mechanism but is specific to plexus right now.

The windows scripts from plexus live in this director just now, we need to be
using scripts base on the current JSW release, but there are too many differences
to switch easily.
