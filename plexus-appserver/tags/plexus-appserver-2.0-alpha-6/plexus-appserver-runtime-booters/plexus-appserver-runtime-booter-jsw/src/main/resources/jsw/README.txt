The directory structures here are copies verbatim of the tarballs/zips
provided by the project. I would eventually like to be able to pull them from 
the repository. The only change here is putting the common platform
independent files in a commons directory. Eventually this will be a
platform neutral mechanism but is specific to plexus right now.
