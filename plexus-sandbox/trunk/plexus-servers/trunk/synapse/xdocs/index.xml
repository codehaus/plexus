        The Acceptor-Connector design pattern decouples the connection and initialization
        of cooperating peer services in a networked system from the processing performed by
        the peer services after they are connected and initialized.

        A real-life implementation of the Acceptor-Connector pattern is often found in organizations
        that provide secretaries for their managers. A manager wishing to make a phone call to another
        manager asks her secretary to establish the call rather than doing it herself. However, the call
        is not received by the called manager directly, but by his secretary. Once the connection is
        established it is then passed to the managers. In terms of the Acceptor-Connector pattern, the
        secretary that initiates the call is the connector, the secretary that receives the call is
        the acceptor and the two managers are the peer service handlers.
