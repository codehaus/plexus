      This package contains a number of utility classes to parse and
      work with URLs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The {@link java.net.URL} class already provides most of the functionality
      covered by this package, but certain limitations in its implementation
      (for example, all schemes <i>must</i> be registered with the
      {java.net.URLStreamHandler} class before they can be used), prompted
      the re-development of a similar API.
    </p>

      For further details on what the different classes in this package mean
      and how they interact, see the {@link it.could.util.location.Location}
      class documentation, but as a reference, this is a picture outlining
      the structure:
