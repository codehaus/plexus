File Selectors

  A file selector is a plexus component, which allows to select certain
  files out of a given set. For example, the {{{http://plexus.codehaus.org/plexus-archiver}Plexus Archiver}}
  uses file selectors to select the files being archived out of a base directory.
  Its counterpart, the Plexus Unarchiver allows to restrict the files to unarchive.

  File mappers are implementing the interface
  {{{apidocs/org/codehaus/plexus/components/io/fileselectors/FileSelector.html}FileSelector}}.

  Available file selectors are

  * The {{{#All Files Selector}All Files Selector}}; it uses the role hints
    "default", or "all".

  * The {{{#Standard File Selector}Standard File Selector}}; its role hint
    is "standard".

* {All Files Selector}

  The {{{apidocs/org/codehaus/plexus/components/io/fileselectors/AllFilesFileSelector.html}selector
  for all files}} doesn't exclude any files. It is mainly useful when you want to avoid the
  value null for a file selector.

  A configuration snippet for using the selector for all files would look like this:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <fileSelector implementation="org.codehaus.plexus.components.io.fileselectors.AllFilesFileSelector"/>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The selector for all files uses the role hints "all", or "default".

* {Standard File Selector}

  The {{{apidocs/org/codehaus/plexus/components/io/fileselectors/IncludeExcludeFileSelector}
  standard file selector}} selects files based on include/exclude patterns.

  A configuration snippet for using the standard file selector would look like this:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <fileSelector implementation="org.codehaus.plexus.components.io.filemappers.FileExtensionMapper">
    <includes>
      <include>**/*.gif</include>
      <include>**/*.png</include>
      <include>**/*.jpg</include>
      <include>**/*.jpeg</include>
    </includes>
    <excludes>
      <exclude>bar/</exclude>
    </excludes>
    <useDefaultExcludes>true</useDefaultExcludes>
    <caseSensitive>false</caseSensitive>
  </fileSelector>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  This would include all image files, with the exception of those in the
  directory <<<bar>>>. The default excludes (for example <<<CVS/>>>) would
  apply and file names would be treated case insensitive.
