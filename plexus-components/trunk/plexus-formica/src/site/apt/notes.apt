composition:

form -> model

Take a set of data elements from a form and combine them into a single datum.

Example:

1) CVS

2) :pserver:jvanzyl@cvs.apache.org:/var/cvs

3) theModule

Compose these as: scm: + 1 + 2 + ":" + 3

decomposition:

model -> form

Take a single datum and decompose into the constituent data elements which
will initially populate a form.
