o Need to deal with bidirection population. By that I mean I need to make it
easy to populate a target object with form values and easily populate a form
values with an existing target object.

o Have to account for populating values into nested object graphs where
intermediary objects may not have been constructed yet. In the example test
I'm checking for null when the nested object is requested but this would not
be easy to add for all getters in something like generated code. My particular
use-case is Castor generated object graphs which are huge. I haven't actually
checked OGNL but I doubt it creates the necessary objects along the way.

--> actually I could probably advise the required methods construct and set
    the necessary objects.
