Redback Integration

 Currently there is only one integration available for use with redback.  We provide a webapp overlay that will seamlessly integrate with a webwork application to provide virtually all of your security needs.  It comes configured with default system administrator roles and a host of other features.  For a complete listing of what comes with the webwork integration just look for that guide.
