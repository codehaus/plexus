This package defines the basic implementation for each of the components.

<p>

The code defined in this package (and sub packages) should not use any additional dependencies
beyond those used by the core package.  This will allow this package to be compiled and provided
with the core API.  Implementations that required additional dependencies should be created
under packages that reflect the dependency, such as org.codehaus.jboss, or org.codehaus.nio, etc.
