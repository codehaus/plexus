Running the XSiter Deployer application
---------------------------------------

1)  On the checked out XSiter application source, run the following Maven goal
    from command prompt 
    
    >  mvn clean package
    
    This will assemble the XSiter application along with all the requisite 
    dependencies.
    
2)  Copy the assembled XSiter application under target/xsiter-deployer to a 
    location of choice.
    
3)  Change directory to the new 'xsiter-deployer' location and run the 
    following command to invoke the deployer application. 
    
    >  ./bin/deployer 
    
4)  Follow the prompts to invoke the operations on the deployer app. 

NOTE that the SCM url requested while setting up a deployment workspace is 
expected to be entered in the same format as it appears inside a pom.xml
