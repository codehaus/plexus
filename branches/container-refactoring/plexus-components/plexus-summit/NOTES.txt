o TODO: doc client configuration

o Notes on client configuration:

o We can make standard components available like valves and pull tools but how
  the valves and pull tools are used in the client application is left up to
  the client and must be done by the client.

o Displays and resolvers should be configured by the user but we can leave some
  defaults in here.
