  <section name="Basic Package">
    <p>
	  The basic package (org.apache.fulcrum.jasf.impl.basic) provides a bunch of
	  ResourceAccessControllers to secure your resources.  They are all xml based and
	  entities being passed to them must inherit the BasicEntity interface.
    </p>
    <p>
      See BasicSecurityTest for info on how to use it at this point.
