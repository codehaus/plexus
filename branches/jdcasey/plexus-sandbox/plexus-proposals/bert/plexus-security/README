This is a bolt on security package for plexus. It is here only for discussion and to kick around ideas.

Through this one can provide  method level access control to components, authentication 
and thread based security (ie security concerns follow the thread)

Note that the API in this module is VERY unstable and is subject to rapid change without notice. 
No backward compatiblity is even attempted to be kept. Use this package for experimental 
purposes only.

A number of classes are included which should eventually be moved into plexus proper, 
but I have put them in here for now so this can be discussed
