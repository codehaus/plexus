     * 1. Add a component at runtime
     *    -> Additions could be made by specifying an URL which will be compatible with Wagon
     *       and specifically Maven's way of using Wagon.
     *
     * 2. Configure the dynamically added component
     *    -> We need to be able to deal with different flavours of components but we can focus
     *       on Plexus components to start with. But some components may have meta information
     *       and some may not like pico components. But one of the first flavours I want to
     *       support is phoenix components because I specifically need the FTP server.
     *
     * 3. Let the component perform its role
     *
     * 4. Suspend the component
     *    a) Define the criteria for which we can suspend a component
     *       -> When there are no client connections?
     *       -> Even when there are no connections and a client tries to obtain a connection what do we do?
     *       -> If we are in desperate need to suspend the component, say for urgent security requirement, and
     *          clients simply won't bugger off what do we do?
     *
     * 5. Reconfigure the component
     *
     * 6. Resume the component
     *
     * 7. Let the component perform its role
     *
     * 8. Release the component

     * can just refuse to allow the component substitution. This shouldn't be trial
     * and error but until much field testing has occurred I'm sure there will be
     * instances where miscalculations happen simply due to lack of experience and
     * usage with dynamic component replacement.
