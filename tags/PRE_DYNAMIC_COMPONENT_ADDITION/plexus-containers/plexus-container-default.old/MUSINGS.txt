- A component's Key should _not_ be the simple concatenation of Role
  and Hint (or Id) because this might clash with another valid Role.
  Perhaps it would be better to use a '/' as a separator, although
  that doesn't resolve the issue completely either because role names
  can be anything.

  Note: Pete and I have agreed we will use "/" and forbid that character
  from being used in role names. I change this later this week as I've have
  oodles of places where I use the concatenation instead of lookup(role,hint).
