o Need to make a place for components so that I can run the reactor
  over the whole set to make the lookup table for retrieving components
  in the configuration. DONE.

o The lookup table of components needs to become an artifact so that it
  can always be consulted when someone is trying to assemble a container.
  This can be an option anyway so that people using plexus know when
  new components are available.

o Do not store the plexus POM in the plugin. It needs to be retrieved
  from the repository. Which means that I need a mechanism to get the
  path of a dependency that is not a JAR, which is what is assumed
  right now. I want to pull the Plexus POM into the repository and
  use it from the repository.
