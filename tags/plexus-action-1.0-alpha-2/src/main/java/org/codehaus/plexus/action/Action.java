/**
 * An <code>Action</code in Plexus is meant to model the UML notion of an Action as closely
 * as possible.
 * <p/>
 * An action is an executable atomic computation. Actions may include operation calls, the
 * creation or destruction of another object, or the sending of a signal to an object.
 * <p/>
 * An action is atomic, meaning that it cannot be interrupted by an event and therefore
 * runs to completion. This is in contrast to an activity, which may be interrupted
 * by other events. 89
