      Decouples the behaviour of service from the point in time at which
      service implementations are configured into an application or system.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This decoupling improves the modularity of services and allows services
      to evolve over time independently of configuration issues (such as
      whether two services must be co-located or what concurrency will be used to
      execute the services).
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In addition, the Service Configurator pattern centralizes the
      administration of the services it configures. This facilitates automatic
      initialization and termination of services and can improve performance
      by factoring common service initialization and termination patterns into
      efficient reusable components.
