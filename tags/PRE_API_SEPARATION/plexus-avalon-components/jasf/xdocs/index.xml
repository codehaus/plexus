      JASF (Java Application Security Framework) seeks 
      to establish a common ground for 
      applications to integrate security for users, computers or 
      anything else that interacts with one's code.  By creating a 
      flexible mechanism, one can use different security methods, 
      but still use the same Components from application to application.
    </p>
    <p>
      The framework creates this flexible mechanism by utilizing the Command 
      Pattern.  See your local bookstore for more on this pattern.

      The framework can be downloaded <a href="./jasf-0.2.tar.gz">here</a> and
      the source code can be found <a href="./jasf-0.2-src.tar.gz">here</a>.
