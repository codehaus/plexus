			You probably want to get summit up'n running and to give you a head start you can look at the email from Dan Diephouse to the Plexus Dev mailing list.

Here, I had this from my early experimentations:

http://dan.envoisolutions.com/summit-demo.tar.gz

The servlet needs access to the ServiceManager, so we stick it in the context.  
If you something like Tomcat then this needs to be done before the servlet loads - 
hence PlexusLoaderServlet.  

However, in embedded situations, the servlet container is embedded into your app 
and you stick the ServiceManager into the ServletContext with the application that 
loads the servlet container component.

Also, for some reason you seem to need to specify the target at the moment.  
I just threw this together, maybe the default file needs to be changed to Index.vm 
instead of Default.vm in the configuration I don't know.  

So access the servlet like so:
http://localhost/summit-demo/servlet/turbine/target/Index.vm
