/**
 * note:jvz This really indicates there is a flaw in the design of the component composer as constructors will not work. If the
 * component has no default constructor then the component must be created with using the constructor that has requirements
 * as its parameters. So in this case the factory is the means of composition as well. Really you need to collect all the
 * information and create and compose.
