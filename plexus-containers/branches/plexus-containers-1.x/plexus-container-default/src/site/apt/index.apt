Overview

  <<<plexus-default-container>>> is Plexus' <inversion-of-control> (IoC) container. It is composed of:

  * its public API: the root class is
  <<<{{{./apidocs/org/codehaus/plexus/PlexusContainer.html}org.codehaus.plexus.PlexusContainer}}>>>,

  * its default implementation: the root class is
  <<<{{{./apidocs/org/codehaus/plexus/DefaultPlexusContainer.html}org.codehaus.plexus.DefaultPlexusContainer}}>>>.

  []


  Default implementation reads configuration in XML files:

  * multiple <<<{{{./plexus-components.html}META-INF/plexus/components.xml}}>>> files that declare components,

  * one <<<{{{./plexus-configuration.html}META-INF/plexus/plexus.xml}}>>> file that can be used to configure
  the plexus container and runtime in addition to declaring components.

  []

  But it is not limited to these files: Plexus container is by nature very extensible, it can be configured
  programmatically too or extended to read configuration from any source. It is used for example in Maven 2 to
  read plugins configuration from <<<META-INF/maven/plugin.xml>>> and instanciate Mojos downloaded from
  Maven repositories.
