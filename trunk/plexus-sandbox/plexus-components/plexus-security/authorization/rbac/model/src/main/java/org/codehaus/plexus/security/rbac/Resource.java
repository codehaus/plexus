/**
 * Resource
 *
 * Resources are things that can be paired up with operations inside of a
 * permission.
 *
 * Rbac doesn't strictly specify what a resource (or Object) is, so there are a
 * couple of variations planned for resources.
 *
 * Initially the resource is simply a string representaton of whatever you desire
 * to match up to an operation.  Eventually we want to support different types of
 * expression evaluation for these resources, like a tuple resource.  *-* where
 * wildcards can be used on the resource definition to streamline the assigning of
 * permissions for _large_ sets of things.
