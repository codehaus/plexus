Using Jetty with Apache

  This is a small guide showing how to setup a Plexus web application behind 
  Apache efficiently using mod_rewrite and mod_proxy.

Settting up Apache

 Whether you are building Apache yourself or getting a binary you must make
 sure that the mod_rewrite and mod_proxy modules are enabled. If you are 
 building Apache yourself then you want to make sure you enable the
 mod_proxy and mod_rewrite modules by using the <<<configure>>> command
 like the following:
 
+-----+
./configure \
"--with-layout=Apache" \
"--prefix=/home/jvanzyl/apache/server" \
"--enable-module=auth_digest" \
"--enable-module=proxy" \
"--enable-module=vhost_alias" \
"--enable-module=headers" \
"--enable-module=rewrite" \
"--enable-module=so" \
"--enable-module=digest" \
"$@"
+-----+

* Apache mod_rewrite rules

 If your application is called ${application} then your mod_rewrite rules
 generally look like the following:
 
+-----+
RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule ^/${application} http://localhost:8081/${application}/servlet/${application} [p]
RewriteRule ^/${application}/(.*)$ http://localhost:8081/${application}/$1 [p]
+-----+

 A concrete example of what the configuration looks like this:

+-----+
RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule ^/docorama http://localhost:8081/docorama/servlet/docorama [p]
RewriteRule ^/docorama/(.*)$ http://localhost:8081/docorama/$1 [p]
+-----+

Setting up the Plexus Jetty component
 
 In order for the pages being served from Jetty to play nice with Apache you must
 setup a <<<proxy-listener>>> which will take the request being proxied from
 Apache and return all resources with proxied port. The proxied port is 
 simply the port that Apache is running on. An example configuration is
 something like the following:

+-----+
    <component>
      <role>org.codehaus.plexus.jetty.ServletContainer</role>
      <implementation>org.codehaus.plexus.jetty.JettyServletContainer</implementation>
      <configuration>
        <socket-listeners>
          <socket-listener>
            <host>*</host>
            <port>8080</port>
          </socket-listener>
        </socket-listeners>
        <proxy-listeners>
          <proxy-listener>
            <host>localhost</host>
            <port>8081</port>
            <proxy-port>9000</proxy-port>
          </proxy-listener>
        </proxy-listeners>
        <webapps-directory>${plexus.home}/apps/docorama/web</webapps-directory>
        <extract-wars>true</extract-wars>
      </configuration>
    </component>
+-----+

 As you can see you can setup any number of listeners that you want. So you can
 access your web application directly via Jetty or proxied via Apache. Note that
 you must set the host for the proxy listener explicity i.e. don't use the
 the wildcard asterix value.
