# The "log_accum.conf" file overrides the the defaults hard-coded in

# cvs commit messages.


# MAIL TO
#
# When set, specifies the email address(es) to
# receive commit messages. When left unset, the 
# script will attempt to guess the correct 
# mailing list using the repository name and
# the MLISTHOST option.

MAIL_TO = scm@plexus.codehaus.org

# MAIL FROM
#
# When set, specifies the email address that
# all commit messages will be sent from.
# Very usefull for setting up a "no reply"
# address for commit messages.
# 
# When not set, the script will guess the sender's
# address by prefixing the cvs user's name to the
# MLISTHOST option.

# the TO or FROM addresses.

# X-SENDER EMAIL HEADER
# 
# When specified, adds an X-Sender header to the 
# emails sent so that users can use it to more
# easily filter out cvs messages.  This is very
# nice for when there is no mailing list 
# dedicated to cvs commit messages.
#

# REPLOY-TO EMAIL ADDRESS
# 
# When REPLYTO is set an SMTP "Reply-To" email
# header will be added.  This is very useful
# for keeping development discussion on a 
# dev list even when cvs messages go a cvs list.
#

# SUBJECT PREFIX
#
# This text, plus a space, will be prepended
