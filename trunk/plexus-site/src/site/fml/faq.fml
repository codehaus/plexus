      <question>How mature is Plexus?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Plexus has been in development for around 5 years, and the container API has been stable for over a year.
          Due to its heavy use in the production level application Maven 2, it is very well tested.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, Plexus was originally based on the Apache Avalon Framework, which was used in a large number
          of production applications and frameworks and has existed for much longer, showing that the techniques used
          are sound.

    <faq id="popularity">
      <question>Why isn't Plexus more popular?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          While Plexus has been around for a number of years, it has never been widely promoted as a standalone
          product. The focus for its development have been to provide a container that could facilitate the needs of
          advanced application architectures such as Maven 2.0's plugin model.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the stable release of Maven 2.0, Plexus as a standalone product has received more attention, as it is
          used to write Maven 2.0 plugins, and the benefits that it can provide to general application development can
          be seen.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, Plexus has become attractive to those that need an application container, but for which the more
          popular frameworks such as Spring do not have the necessary capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the upcoming Plexus 1.0 release, and its advanced features and integration with other frameworks,
          we hope that Plexus will become a more popular choice for all application developers in the future.
