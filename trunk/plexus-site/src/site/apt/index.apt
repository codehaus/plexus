The Plexus project seeks to create end-to-end developer tools for writing applications.  At the core is the container, which can be embedded or for a full scale application server.  There are many reusable components for hibernate, form processing, jndi, i18n, velocity, etc.  Plexus also includes an [application server|Plexus Application Server] which is like a J2EE application server, without all the baggage.

To start developing plexus applications read see the [One Minute Tutorial] or the [Five Minute Tutorial].
