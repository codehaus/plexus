Configuration files
 
* Plexus is using the following configuration files
 
  * plexus.xml

  * plexus.properties

  * components.xml files stored in jars

 All components which can be used by plexus must have a {{{component-descriptor.html}Component Descriptor}}.

 
 Component Descriptors can be declared in two places:  <<plexus.xml>> and in <<components.xml>> files which are kept in jars (META-INF/plexus/components.xml).
 
 
 <<plexus.xml>> files allows you to configure the following aspects of application:
 
  * Define new component descriptors

  * Override component descriptors which are defined in components.xml files

  * Set up LoggerManager for the Application.

  * Choose which component should be loaded on startup

 ~~TODO Explain Component repository
  * Location of {{{#}component repository}}
 
 Plexus component descriptor contains many pieces which must be provided only once. For example componet requiremnets, profile
 etc are pratically constant.
 
 That's why it is profitable to put such information into jar files and reuse it.
 
 
 <<plexus.properties>> file is used for seeding {{{#}plexus context}} which is then used for interpolation of variables in xml configuration files
 (see the explanation below)
 
 
* Component configuration through <<</META-INF/plexus/components.xml>>>

 When starting up Plexus will start discovering components. The default configuration uses the {{{http://svn.plexus.codehaus.org/plexus/trunk/plexus-container/src/java/org/codehaus/plexus/component/discovery/DefaultComponentDiscoverer.java?rev=HEAD&view=auto}DefaultComponentDiscoverer}} to discover components.
 
 The {{{#}DefaultComponentDiscoverer}} will look for <<</META-INF/plexus/components.xml>>>
 files using {{{http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/ClassLoader.html#getResources(java.lang.String)}ClassLoader.getResources()}}. For getting your components picked up by plexus all you need is to have the {{{#}components.xml}} file in your jar.
 
 
* Interpolation of configuration files

 Plexus will interpolate all the variables that are strings in the plexus context in the configuration file.  For instance, the "plexus.home" is a context variable that tells you the location of the Plexus install.  To use that in your configuration, you would do something like this:

+-------------------------+
 <configuration>
   <directory>${plexus.home}/directory</directory>
 </configuration>
+-------------------------+

 This would automatically be expanded to the full directory name when you configure your component.
